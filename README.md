#           SDG12-Resources-Data-Analysis-India-2016-2021
Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production, a topic so chosen to perform analysis on energy, power units, food grains,  covid-19 resources and waste generation across Indian states.

A detailed project consisting of survey of literature, collected data, and descriptive and inferential statistics including hypothesis testing for the trends energy, power units, food grains,  covid-19 resources and waste generation in different states of India in the years 2016-2021. 
Used Python to perform various computation tasks of regression, correlation, ranking the states and more using libraries.  

#              Objectives
The main objective of this report is to analyse the production and consumption of 
various entities like electricity, food grains, medical equipment. On analysing the 
above-mentioned resource consuming entities, we aim to analyse the quantity of 
waste treated out of the total waste generated. To achieve the objectives, we have 
used the inferential and the descriptive statistics. Mean, Standard Deviation, 
Statistical tests like the- single mean tests, difference of means, linear regression 
and corelation are some of the methods taken in use. The hypothesis tests have 
been used to compare the means whether it is intra-sample or not. One of the 
underlying objectives of this report is to spread awareness regarding the 
appropriate or over or bad usage and production of resources. From the 
discussions, the very objective of goal 12- Responsible Consumption and 
production gets highlighted. 
Keywords: resource consuming entities, consumption, production, statistics, goal 
12- Responsible Consumption and production.
