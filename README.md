Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production, a topic so chosen to perform analysis on energy, power units, food grains,  covid-19 resources and waste generation across Indian states.

A detailed project consisting of survey of literature, collected data, and descriptive and inferential statistics including hypothesis testing for the trends energy, power units, food grains,  covid-19 resources and waste generation in different states of India in the years 2016-2021. 
Used Python to perform various computation tasks of regression, correlation, ranking the states and more using libraries.  


#              Objectives
The main objective of this report is to analyse the production and consumption of 
various entities like electricity, food grains, medical equipment. On analysing the 
above-mentioned resource consuming entities, we aim to analyse the quantity of 
waste treated out of the total waste generated. To achieve the objectives, we have 
used the inferential and the descriptive statistics. Mean, Standard Deviation, 
Statistical tests like the- single mean tests, difference of means, linear regression 
and corelation are some of the methods taken in use. The hypothesis tests have 
been used to compare the means whether it is intra-sample or not. One of the 
underlying objectives of this report is to spread awareness regarding the 
appropriate or over or bad usage and production of resources. From the 
discussions, the very objective of goal 12- Responsible Consumption and 
production gets highlighted. 

Keywords: resource consuming entities, consumption, production, statistics, goal 
12- Responsible Consumption and production. 

#Introduction
The sustainable development goals as embraced by the United Nations in 2015 is 
a practice of a universal call against the bad practices and the situations like 
poverty, hunger, AIDS, unequal distribution of resources, polluted environment, 
crimes like discrimination towards women etc. 

It tries to ensure that by 2030, people gain happiness and peace, and until then 
these 17 goals are followed. 

#SDG-12 Responsible Consumption and Productiom
SDGs are divided into Social, Economic, Governance, and Environment goals. 
Goal 12 comes under the environment one. 
This goal aims to achieve some of the practices till 2030 like- sustainable 
management and efficient use of natural resources, halving the global food waste, 
changing the way we consume and other resources like medical facilities and the 
raw food items like grains, cereals etc.

# Objective Statements
 
Objective 1: To Analyse the State-Wise Energy Consumption and Production in different states of India. 
 
Objective 2: To Analyse the Consumption and Production of Medical Facilities in different states of India. 
 
Objective 3: To Analyse the Production and Consumption of Food Grains in different states of India.
 
Objective 4: To Analyse the Generation, Collection and hence the treatment of solid waste produced in different states.

# CONCLUSION 
 
• After conducting various tests and studying the data we highlight the very 
objective and the title of this report which is Sustainable Living. From the first 3 
objective we understand how the consumption of resources is increasing and is 
also estimated to increase in upcoming years. it also states how did over 
production of some resources like food grains in India we also see how the 
population of India affect the usage of this resources which is increasing with the 
increase in population. In some states, the use of these resources is very much as 
mentioned in the conclusions. 
 
• But, in the 4th objective we see how in the past few years the waste generation has 
been increasing. Although there is a strong correlation between waste collected 
and generated, but then too the waste treated is much less than the waste 
generated.  
 
• If we continue to follow the same trend, then the waste generation is also expected 
to increase. 
 
• So, with pure evidence, we can say that in order to have a sustainable living, and 
ensuring the resources availability for the future generations, we need to have a 
proper check of the production of resources. We shall try to limit our consumption 
and wisely produce these resources-consuming entities.
