#           SDG12-Resources-Data-Analysis-India-2016-2021
Sustainable Development Goal 12 - Responsible Consumption and Production, a topic so chosen to perform analysis on energy, power units, food grains,  covid-19 resources and waste generation across Indian states.

A detailed project consisting of survey of literature, collected data, and descriptive and inferential statistics including hypothesis testing for the trends energy, power units, food grains,  covid-19 resources and waste generation in different states of India in the years 2016-2021. 
Used Python to perform various computation tasks of regression, correlation, ranking the states and more using libraries.  

#              Objectives
The main objective of this report is to analyse the production and consumption of 
various entities like electricity, food grains, medical equipment. On analysing the 
above-mentioned resource consuming entities, we aim to analyse the quantity of 
waste treated out of the total waste generated. To achieve the objectives, we have 
used the inferential and the descriptive statistics. Mean, Standard Deviation, 
Statistical tests like the- single mean tests, difference of means, linear regression 
and corelation are some of the methods taken in use. The hypothesis tests have 
been used to compare the means whether it is intra-sample or not. One of the 
underlying objectives of this report is to spread awareness regarding the 
appropriate or over or bad usage and production of resources. From the 
discussions, the very objective of goal 12- Responsible Consumption and 
production gets highlighted. 

Keywords: resource consuming entities, consumption, production, statistics, goal 
12- Responsible Consumption and production. 

#Introduction
The sustainable development goals as embraced by the United Nations in 2015 is 
a practice of a universal call against the bad practices and the situations like 
poverty, hunger, AIDS, unequal distribution of resources, polluted environment, 
crimes like discrimination towards women etc. 

It tries to ensure that by 2030, people gain happiness and peace, and until then 
these 17 goals are followed. 

#SDG-12 Responsible Consumption and Productiom
SDGs are divided into Social, Economic, Governance, and Environment goals. 
Goal 12 comes under the environment one. 
This goal aims to achieve some of the practices till 2030 like- sustainable 
management and efficient use of natural resources, halving the global food waste, 
changing the way we consume and other resources like medical facilities and the 
raw food items like grains, cereals etc. 

# Objective Statements
 
Objective 1: To Analyse the State-Wise Energy Consumption and Production in different states of India.
1.1 To check if the population’s demand for mean energy units from 2016 
to 2021.
1.2 To study the effect of energy units demand on the production of energy 
units in India.  
1.3 To predict the consumption of energy units in next five years based on 
current trend in energy consumption. 
1.4 To evaluate the significance of variance in the production of power 
units from the year 2016-17 to 2020-21 for 36 states and union territories 
of India. 
 
Objective 2: To Analyse the Consumption and Production of Medical Facilities in different states of India. 
2.1 To designate different states based on the no. of beds provided in the 
year 2019. 
2.2 To check if the number of mean medical beds provided in the hospitals 
has significantly increased from 2019 to 2020.  
2.3 To study the dependence of population on number of beds. 
 
Objective 3: To Analyse the Production and Consumption of Food Grains in different states of India.
3.1 To check if the production of rice and pulses has significantly increased 
from 2018-19 to 2019-20.  
3.2 To study the effect on production of rice and pluses in 2019-20 with 
respect to the population of same year.
3.3 To designate different states with respect to sum of production of food 
grains (rice and pulses) in year 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. 
3.4 To analyse the sum of consumption of rice and pulse in 2019-2020. 
 
Objective 4: To Analyse the Generation, Collection and hence the treatment of solid waste produced in different states.
4.1 To designate different states in India based on total waste generated 
from year 2016-17 to 2017-18.
4.2 To check if there is a significant difference between the means of waste 
collected and treated in the years 2016-17 to 2017-18. 
4.3 To study the relation between the waste generated and collected in India 
in the years 2016-2020. 
4.4 To predict the generation of solid waste in the next five years on the 
basis of current trend. 


# CONCLUSION 
 
• After conducting various tests and studying the data we highlight the very 
objective and the title of this report which is Sustainable Living. From the first 3 
objective we understand how the consumption of resources is increasing and is 
also estimated to increase in upcoming years. it also states how did over 
production of some resources like food grains in India we also see how the 
population of India affect the usage of this resources which is increasing with the 
increase in population. In some states, the use of these resources is very much as 
mentioned in the conclusions. 
 
• But, in the 4th objective we see how in the past few years the waste generation has 
been increasing. Although there is a strong correlation between waste collected 
and generated, but then too the waste treated is much less than the waste 
generated.  
 
• If we continue to follow the same trend, then the waste generation is also expected 
to increase. 
 
• So, with pure evidence, we can say that in order to have a sustainable living, and 
ensuring the resources availability for the future generations, we need to have a 
proper check of the production of resources. We shall try to limit our consumption 
and wisely produce these resources-consuming entities.
